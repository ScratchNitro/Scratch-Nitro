## Reporting a Vulnerability

If something does not behave as usually, let us know by going into the Discussions tab, and then making a new topic about the issue. A good tutorial of what to write in the description can be found [here](https://github.com/ScratchNitro/Scratch-Nitro/discussions/13). We will try to look at it as soon as possible!
