Marc92020 and JackyBorderCollie have decided to make a browser extension. But not any kind of extension! It's an extension similar to Scratch Addons, but it enables the features that are in Scratch Nitro, so everyone can experience it! Moreover, it would be much easier to make sneak peek videos with it.
## How do we do this?
We are looking for a good coder, that can make browser extensions, like Scratch Addons. We plan on inviting Jeffalo over, because he contributes to Scratch Addons too.
## Pros and Cons
### Pros
- More users can experience Scratch Nitro
- Way easier to make Scratch Nitro sneak peek videos
- We now know how to get it onto the webstore (well, at least me, @Marc92020)
- We now know how Scratchcoins will work
### Cons
- A good extension coder is required
- Others that don't have the extension won't see the special features
- It isn't possible to mention the extension on Scratch, or Scratch Forums
- To get it onto the Chrome Webstore we need to create a Chrome Developers account and we need to pay 5 dollars using a credit card
### How will Scratchcoins work?
Scratchcoins will work by using extension features very often. You start off with 0 scratchcoins (because normal scratch nitro is free) and the more Scratchcoins you get, the more Scratch Nitro ranks you can get! You can also get Scratchcoins by loving, favoriting, remixing, commenting, posting in forums, following, sharing projects, following studios, inviting curators to studios, being a studio curator, being front paged, being a front page curator, and also by creting a studio.
